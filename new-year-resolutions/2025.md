# Resolutions

I will keep calling the file resolutions, even though it now is more of themes in which I set quarterly goals.
This way, I aim to make it easier for myself what to focus on each quarter and also not think that there is a lot of the year to get around to do anything.

## Overview

In 2025, I will strive to do work in the following themes:

1. **Sustainability**: Wikimedians for Sustainable Development and the Office of Carbon Omission.
1. **Openness advocay**: Open By Default, Govdirectory, Wikipediapodden and a new book project.
1. **Learning**: German, climate change, artificial intelligence.
1. **Health**: Running, hiking and eating healthy.
1. **Documentation**: Provide continuous updates here (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of each goal) and quarterly posts on [my blog](https://ainali.com) with a summary of my activities and the progress with respect to the goals below, including thoughts on and into the future.

Always respecting my [pledges](https://github.com/Ainali/pledges).
