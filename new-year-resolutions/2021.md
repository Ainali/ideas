- 2021-01-01 Reading the column [Yes, itâ€™s all the fault of Big Oil, Facebook and â€˜the systemâ€™. But letâ€™s talk about you this time](https://thecorrespondent.com/796/yes-its-all-the-fault-of-big-oil-facebook-and-the-system-but-lets-talk-about-you-this-time/105316520056-9134847d) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101075435/https://thecorrespondent.com/796/yes-its-all-the-fault-of-big-oil-facebook-and-the-system-but-lets-talk-about-you-this-time/105316520056-9134847d)) that as the title suggest talks about the tension and connection between structural and personal choices. A good read that really makes a good case for documenting my progress on this level.
- 2021-01-01 Completed the [Climate Hero](https://climatehero.me/) Carbon Calculator, which gave me a result of [2,9 ton/year](https://climatehero.me/thank-you/?id=Jan_2.4). However, I suspect the coarsness of it combined with 2020 put me generously low.
- 2021-01-01: I responded to the [UN's 75th anniversary public consultation](https://un75.online/).
- 2021-01-01: I [signed](https://twitter.com/Jan_Ainali/status/1345129415060152322) (as signatory number 3676) the [petition for the UN Security Council to declare a Climate Emergency](https://www.now.world/global_climate_emergency).


## Formalize my pledges

I have now set up https://github.com/Ainali/pledges for this purpose. I am approaching this pretty seriously so far, but [here](https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp/status/1225469483432783872) is a more humorous angle as well for good measure.

## Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year


## Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above
