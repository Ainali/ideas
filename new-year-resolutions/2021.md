## Review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability

### Generic notes

- Even before 2021 I 
   - became vegan
   - stopped flying for pleasure
   - switched to renewable energy at home
   - placed my pension savings in green funds
   - became a member of [the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation](https://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/)

### Professional

### Volunteer

- 2021-01-02: I [signed](https://twitter.com/Jan_Ainali/status/1345269648607113216) (as signatory number 3940) a [petition to allow remote presentations at conferences](http://chng.it/dHGGM29R5n).
- 2021-01-23: Got [a minigrant](https://se.wikimedia.org/wiki/%C3%84mne:W1zsd3zo52u4fbf3) to buy the book Klimatkrisens Sverige to use as a source in Wikipedia articles on climate change.
- 2021-02-11: Was really inspired by a podcast on [turning knowledge activists into Wikipedians](https://headstuffpodcasts.com/episode/building-a-sustainable-wikipedia).
- 2021-02-15: Gave an introduction course to people interested in improving the article about [climate compensation in Swedish Wikipedia](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klimatkompensation).

### Personal

- 2021-01-01 Reading the column [Yes, itâ€™s all the fault of Big Oil, Facebook and â€˜the systemâ€™. But letâ€™s talk about you this time](https://thecorrespondent.com/796/yes-its-all-the-fault-of-big-oil-facebook-and-the-system-but-lets-talk-about-you-this-time/105316520056-9134847d) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101075435/https://thecorrespondent.com/796/yes-its-all-the-fault-of-big-oil-facebook-and-the-system-but-lets-talk-about-you-this-time/105316520056-9134847d)) that as the title suggest talks about the tension and connection between structural and personal choices. A good read that really makes a good case for documenting my progress on this level.
- 2021-01-01 Completed the [Climate Hero](https://climatehero.me/) Carbon Calculator, which gave me a result of [2,9 ton/year](https://climatehero.me/thank-you/?id=Jan_2.4). However, I suspect the coarsness of it combined with 2020 put me generously low.
- 2021-01-01: I responded to the [UN's 75th anniversary public consultation](https://un75.online/).
- 2021-01-01: I [signed](https://twitter.com/Jan_Ainali/status/1345129415060152322) (as signatory number 3676) the [petition for the UN Security Council to declare a Climate Emergency](https://www.now.world/global_climate_emergency).
   - 2021-01-05 Since I signed, more than 100 persons have signed up with the link I have been sharing.
- 2021-01-02: [Backed](https://twitter.com/Jan_Ainali/status/1345389669891104769) the [Carbon Tracker app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silvergruppen.carbontracker).
- 2021-01-08: Watch a [video with a sustainability pulse check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60cYtH_PUoA). A few self reflecting questions that I [will do](https://github.com/Ainali/ideas/issues/23).
- 2021-01-10: Inspired by [Daniel's thoughts on trees](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/master/new-year-resolutions/2020.md#family) and convinced by the [How to save a planet podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/brhlrdr/answering-your-treemail-and-nuclear) I installed the [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) browser extension. I might donate directly for trees as well later, but I am trying to find an alternative where one can get some feedback on where and what trees were planted.
- 2021-01-17: Watched the educational movie [Climate Emergency: Feedback Loops](https://feedbackloopsclimate.com/) that was very easy to understand (and also made a [Wikidata item](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104875641) for it).
- 2021-01-19: Signed (as signatory number 2011) a [petition to reform swedish forest policy](https://tystskog.naturskyddsforeningen.se/).

## Formalize my pledges

I have now set up https://github.com/Ainali/pledges for this purpose. I am approaching this pretty seriously so far, but [here](https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp/status/1225469483432783872) is a more humorous angle as well for good measure.

- 2021-01-05: Updated my pledges by adding a section in the FAQ on what video/voice/text messaging tools I can use. This because most of my type of collaborations happen at least partly, if not in majority, through those. And I will challenge myself by only using open source tools. This might lead (and have already) to me skipping some meetings. I see a double win for now: first my schedule get a bit lighter, and secondly I put some pressure on using better tools if people want to collaborate. The other update I needed to do was to restrict the scope of my pledge to volunteer and personal activity since I am not in the position to be able to enforce them in my work. My work is quite open, and try to be examplary, but we are also very pragmatic and accomodating to the people we collaborate with.

## Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year


## Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above
